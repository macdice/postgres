 * streaming_read.c
 *	  Mechanism for buffer access with look-ahead
 *
 * Portions Copyright (c) 2024, PostgreSQL Global Development Group

 *
 * Code that needs to access relation data typically pins blocks one at a
 * time, often in a predictable order that might be sequential or data-driven.
 * Calling the simple ReadBuffer() function for each block is inefficient,
 * because blocks that are not yet in the buffer pool require I/O operations
 * that are small and might stall waiting for storage.  This mechanism looks
 * into the future and calls StartReadBuffers() and WaitReadBuffers() to read
 * neighboring blocks together and ahead of time, with an adaptive look-ahead
 * distance.
 *
 * A user-provided callback generates a stream of block numbers that is used
 * to form reads of up to size buffer_io_size, by attempting to merge them
 * with a pending read.  When that isn't possible, the existing pending read
 * is sent to StartReadBuffers() so that a new one can begin to form.
 *
 * The algorithm for controlling the look-ahead distance tries to classify the
 * stream into three ideal behaviors:
 *
 * A) No I/O is necessary, because the requested blocks are fully cached
 * already.  There is no benefit to looking ahead more than one block, so
 * distance is 1.  This is the default initial assumption.
 *
 * B) I/O is necessary, but fadvise is undesirable because the access is
 * sequential, or impossible because direct I/O is enabled or the system
 * doesn't support advice.  There is no benefit in looking ahead more than
 * buffer_io_size (the GUC controlling physical read size), because in this
 * case only goal is larger read system calls.  Looking further ahead would
 * pin many buffers and perform speculative work looking ahead for no benefit.
 *
 * C) I/O is necesssary, it appears random, and this system supports fadvise.
 * We'll look further ahead in order to reach the configured level of I/O
 * concurrency.
 *
 * The distance increases rapidly and decays slowly, so that it moves towards
 * those levels as different I/O patterns are discovered.  For example, a
 * sequential scan of fully cached data doesn't bother looking ahead, but a
 * sequential scan that hits a region of uncached blocks will start issuing
 * increasingly wide read calls until it plateaus at buffer_io_size.
 *
 * The main data structure is a circular queue of buffers of size
 * max_pinned_buffers, ready to be returned by streaming_read_buffer_next().
 * Each buffer also has an optional variable sized object that is passed from
 * the callback to the consumer of buffers.  A third array records whether
 * WaitReadBuffers() must be called before returning the buffer, and if so,
 * points to the relevant ReadBuffersOperation object.
 *
 * For example, if the callback return block numbers 10, 42, 43, 60 in
 * successive calls, then these data structures might appear as follows:
 *
 *                          buffers buf/data buf/io       ios
 *
 *                          +----+  +-----+  +---+        +--------+
 *                          |    |  |     |  |   |  +---->| 42..44 |
 *                          +----+  +-----+  +---+  |     +--------+
 *   oldest_buffer_index -> | 10 |  |  ?  |  |   |  | +-->| 60..60 |
 *                          +----+  +-----+  +---+  | |   +--------+
 *                          | 42 |  |  ?  |  | 0 +--+ |   |        |
 *                          +----+  +-----+  +---+    |   +--------+
 *                          | 43 |  |  ?  |  |   |    |   |        |
 *                          +----+  +-----+  +---+    |   +--------+
 *                          | 44 |  |  ?  |  |   |    |   |        |
 *                          +----+  +-----+  +---+    |   +--------+
 *                          | 60 |  |  ?  |  | 1 +----+
 *                          +----+  +-----+  +---+
 *     next_buffer_index -> |    |  |     |  |   |
 *                          +----+  +-----+  +---+
 *
 * In the example, 5 buffers are pinned, and the next buffer to be streamed to
 * the client is block 10.  Block 10 was a hit and has no associated I/O, but
 * the range 42..44 requires an I/O wait before its buffers are returned, as
 * does block 60.
